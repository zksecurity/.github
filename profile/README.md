# zkSecurity

ðŸ‘‹ **Welcome to zkSecurity!** We are a security R&D team specializing in advanced cryptography. Our mission is to provide **secure solutions** to modern cryptographic challenges and make systems **secure and future-proof**. We conduct expert **security audits** ðŸ”’ for zero-knowledge protocols, cryptographic algorithms, smart contracts, and more â€“ helping projects find vulnerabilities and strengthen their code before deployment.

Our expertise spans **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)**, **multi-party computation (MPC)**, **fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)**, and **post-quantum cryptography**. The zkSecurity team has audited numerous high-profile projects which you can browse on the [reports page](https://reports.zksecurity.xyz/).

## Featured Projects

Here are a few of our open-source projects and tools ðŸš€:

- **[Noname](https://github.com/zksecurity/noname)** â€“ A high-level programming language for writing **zero-knowledge applications** (zkApps). Inspired by Rust and Go, Noname lets developers easily build zk circuits and proofs. It supports multiple proving systems, currently compiling to R1CS (for SnarkJS) and Kimchi (Minaâ€™s *plonk* proof system).
- **[ZkBugs](https://github.com/zksecurity/zkbugs)** â€“ A curated collection of real-world **ZKP vulnerabilities** with scripts to reproduce each exploit. ZkBugs helps developers learn from past security issues in zero-knowledge protocols, providing hands-on examples of how bugs were exploited and how to prevent similar flaws.
- **[Wasmati](https://github.com/zksecurity/wasmati)** â€“ A **TypeScript library** for writing low-level WebAssembly modules directly from JavaScript. Wasmati empowers developers to hand-craft optimized WebAssembly (WASM) code without needing a separate compiler, making it easier to create performance-critical crypto and ZK primitives in a JS/TS environment.
- **[zkBank](https://github.com/zksecurity/zkbank)** â€“ A capture-the-flag challenge that we use for recruiting. Interested in joining the team? Take a look at it!
